# Python Webapp

# Background
This is a simple project that I have self-developed while working on official projects. Therefore, there might be some parts of the code now unusable as sensitive values/variables have been omitted.

## Tech Stack
* Python + Flask (Web App)
* HTML (Front-end)
* Pytest (Testing)
* RobotFramework (Testing)
* Terraform (IaC)
* Docker (Container)
* Kubernetes/AWS EKS (Container Orchestrator)
* GitLab - omitted

`cli-eks-provion-cluster.sh` no longer needed as it has been converted into a Terraform script
